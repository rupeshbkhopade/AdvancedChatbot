### What were the Honda's main requirements for selecting CATIA 3DEXPERIENCE?

* Requirement 1 -“Connection point” as “Supplier digital collaboration environment” for direct access.
* Solution 1 - HONDA prepared MS Azure as “connection point”. 

* Requirement 2 - No specific VPN to connect HONDA environment and Supplier environment. 
* Solution 2 - DS proposed “Managed DSLS” to install license and it can be accessed by internet.

* Requirement 3 - Suppliers can use licenses both for HONDA work and supplier own work.
* Solution 3A - Same license in “Managed DSLS” can be used both for HONDA work and supplier own work
* Solution 3B - The Product Type is “Shareable” to enable work in both environments.

Supplier Playbook to Honda’s New DPM

Executive Summary
Honda has begun granting roles/licenses to its co-design and Build-to-Print suppliers. 
Honda is transitioning to DPM and scaling co-design with Honda-managed VDI (Microsoft 
Azure). 3DXML is shared to ‘Build To Print’ through a Private Cloud offering. Suppliers are 
facing infra/licensing and process ambiguity. This playbook provides 
(i) immediate actions to stay productive and compliant, and 
(ii) a 12‑month roadmap to adopt the 3DEXPERIENCE Platform.

#1. Context & Objectives
• Programs: Currently, below supplier types are in focus
• Co‑design – A type of supplier who do the collaborative design on the Honda tenant
using VDI, given to them with the roles PCS+MES+TAD.
• Build‑to‑Print - A type of supplier who exclusively do the manufacturing and 
receives HPDF (3DXML) through 3DEXPERIENCE platform private cloud with the 
roles PCS-OP+DRN-OP+EXH-OP.
• Objectives: Educate the Partners and supplier with know-how. Do a workshop with 
Partners, prepare the Sales kit and share it with Partners; migrate to 3DEXPERIENCE 
Platform operating model.

##2. Current State –
• Co-Design - Access provided (1 MES+TAD shareable per program per company max 2);
Maker layout is still not allocated to the suppliers in DPM (Expected in H1 2026)
• B2P suppliers have received 3DEXPERIENCE platform on private cloud invitation starting 
June 2024. Suppliers are able to download the HPDF, extract 3dxml and able to visualize the 
MBD (Model Based Design) data using the (DRN-OP) Digital Mockup Review Engineer role. 
Honda has stopped issuing 2D manufacturing drawings to the suppliers.
• Suppliers need to use the MBD information for downstream manufacturing processes. 
This requires a business process change. Suppliers need guidance to adopt this change and 
set new practices.

##3. Immediate Guidance (0–3 months)
• Upgrade CAD/CAM/PLM tools to support 3DXML with PMI.
-Adopt a New license subscription (SMW-OC/TAD-OC) to generate 2D from 3DXML.

##4. Near‑Term (3–9 months)
• Deploy 3D viewers on the shop floor and QC labs.
• Train workforce in reading 3D PMI (GD&T in 3D context).
- Deployment 3DSWYMER + Collaborative Industry Innovator for production teams. Use 3D 
3D Markup, 3DPlay, Product Explorer, and Issue 3D Review widgets.
- Targeted Roles: Toolroom Engineer, CAE Engineer, Production/manufacturing Engineer, 
Purchase/Sourcing/Buyer, Shopfloor, and Quality Engineer

##5. Long‑Term (9–12 months): 
• Standardize processes so MBD is the single source of truth.
• Integrate MBD into machining and inspection workflows.
• Pilot & phase rollout across programs.
- Digital work instructions, closed‑loop quality (Inspection report/CMM/Quality report).

##6. Licensing & Versions
• B2P: Additional roles (PCS-OC, SMW-OC, TAD-OC)
- 3DEXPERIENCE platform on public cloud

##7. Risks & Mitigations
• H/W and S/W Infra → leverage 3DEXPERIENCE platform in public cloud, partner‑hosted 
infrastructure options.
• Messaging drift → standardized STP page, FAQs, and enablement for partners/suppliers.
