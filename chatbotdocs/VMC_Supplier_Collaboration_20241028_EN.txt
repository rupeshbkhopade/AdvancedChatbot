Main purpose of this day
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend the information session today.
As part of our manufacturing DX, we have worked with our business partners to develop a strong manufacturing structure.
We are making improvements to issues such as mistakes in information that have been returned, requirements and requirements that have been mismatched prior to the drawing.
In particular, for direct data sharing in CATIA V6 cloud environments, and for digital-based schedule matching and problem matching
Prompting the process construction is important in achieving operational efficiency improvements.
Today, we will explain how to collaborate with our design using the Digital Collaboration Environment, and the necessary administrative procedures for use.
We plan to begin using CATIA V6 and Digital Collaboration Environment in HRAP around 
September 2025. For each supplier, please accept CATIA V6 drawings and prepare for delivery.

CAD News Issue
CAD NEWS which was issued on April 29, 2022.

Apply CATIA V6 from 28.5M FMC starting in September 2024.
HONDA's Direction
Honda has set new environmental & safety goals for 2025.
 - Carbon neutral thru all Honda product and company activities
  - Zero death caused by Honda motorcycle/automobile accident To achieve these, Honda will focus on environment and safety.
Honda will continue to "solidify the existing business", which is the foundation for meeting our goals.
For automobile development, we have introduced a new series development flow which will allow Honda to increase parts 
commonality/usage for longer period. Through the execution of digital parts maturation and continuous manufacturability verification & collaboration, errors which cause rework for design can be eliminated and efficiency improved. Mass production quality can be guaranteed prior to drawing issue.

Evolution of Honda's development-process

Key Measures to Realize DPM-Centric Development Style

Key Measures to Realize DPM-Centric Development Style
Measure ?: DPM automatic construction
?Quickly create data to be presented to suppliers without omission
Measure ?: Evolution of DWG
?Improvement of accuracy and efficiency when utilizing information
Measure ?: Distributed data and evolution of data flow
?Reduction of data conversion man-hours and support for various systems/format
Measure ?: Collaboration environment evolution
?Efficient data sharing with suppliers and visualization of exchange history
Measure ?: DPM Automatic Construction

Current concern
* DPM is not delivered until after drawing is issued.
* Cannot check Layout data in timely manner.
* Due to DPM verification delays, data has to be reworked.


DPM will be automatically constructed from layout data and BOM and data presented to suppliers can be gathered quickly without exception.
Measure ?: Evolution of DWG

Current concern
* Modeling and drawing rules are different depending on the regions, functional group and PIC.
* It takes time to understand the intention of the previous PIC when reusing.
* It takes time to inspect the drawing.


Digitization of attribute information improves accuracy and efficiency when checking DWG and utilizing information.
Measure ?: Distribution Data and Evolution of Data Flow

Changes in Drawing Format

3DXML formalization (2/19 ~) Positive: 3dxml+XML+TIFF

3DXML unification JT halted (from Oct. 7) Positive: 3dxml+XML+TIFF

?Please check the previously issued drawings in JT/DARWIN.
Current concern
* Late sharing of L / O and surrounding parts to suppliers
* It is unclear whether the presented data is up to date.
* Rework occurs by 
referring to old data.
* Man-hours for data sharing and transmission / reception are large.
* No history of exchanges remains.
Measure ?: Collaboration Environment Evolution
Direct access makes sharing the latest product data much faster, and history management reduces rework.


Vision for Joint Creation with Business Partners
At present, the main issues in collaboration with business partners are ?Delay in reflection of supplier skills
?Rework due to inadequate sharing of information, such as reference to old surrounding data
 ?Waste man-hours such as information copying and repeated input We believe that improvement is indispensable.
To solve this problem, we have developed a new DPM that digitizes the drawing data, and have developed and verified the product with our suppliers.We will do this efficiently.

Supplier Digital Collaboration Environment - Benefit

 
	? Accuracy and speed of information sharing	19
[High-speed sharing of 3D by DPM auto-build function]
Component information entered in the Digital Collaboration Environment is linked to L/O data, and shared data can be created at high speed by DPM auto-build function that creates DPM data from L/O data.

Achieve quick sharing of 3D data using a Digital Collaboration Environment
 
	? Improvement of work efficiency for designers	20
[Produce efficient DPM and drawings by digitizing attribution data]
?The "box" for attribute input is automatically created from the component information entered in the digital Collaboration environment.
Input the attributes sequentially according to the specification decision.
?You can use this information to generate a drawing.

Use Digital Collaboration to enter properties to build and plot DPM efficiently
? Supporting Remote Work Styles
Current	Environment: GSN

Supplier Digital Collaboration Helpdesk
E-mail : 	 	HRAP_VMC_Helpdesk_Supplier@honda.th.com
We have built a digital collaboration environment (CATIA V6+Cloud) for manufacturer drawings to strengthen Collaboration with our business partners.
In the future, in order to develop HRAP models, we will need to deliver drawings using CATIA V6 and have manufacturers draw the drawings at our suppliers using the cloud. We ask for the cooperation of our business partners in implementing this system.
We ask for your cooperation in coordinating the phased introduction between our design department and our business partners.
Finally, I would like to ask our business partners for their continued understanding and cooperation as we strive to realize "strong manufacturing" that will lead to Honda's growth and evolution. Please.
Thank you very much for today.
